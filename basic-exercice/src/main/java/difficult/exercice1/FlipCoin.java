/**
 * Subject : Coin flip
 *
 * Condition : a coin have 2 values : Head = 0, Tail = 1
 * Objective : Find the minimum coin to flip in order to have consecutively different values.
 *
 * Example :
 * [0, 1, 1, 1, 0] = 1 => we only need to flip the coin in the middle to obtain consecutive values
 *                     => [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
 * [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] = 2 => if we flip the second and the fourth, we have consecutive value
 *                     => [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
 *
 * Other indication : if there is no coin, one coin, no need to flip so the result is 0
